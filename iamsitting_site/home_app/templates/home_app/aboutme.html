                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="{% static 'home_app/images/pic08.jpg' %}" alt="" /></span>I sit alot. School? Sitting. Bible study? Sitting. Traveling? Sitting. Working? Sitting. Yeah that's what I do. However, it's not all I do. I graduated from Texas A&ampM University with a B.S. in electrical engineering (power electronics) and a minor in math. That's also not what I really do. My interest and experience is an odd concoction of embedded and web programming. I am a big fan of IOT and IOT things! I also love history. I've easily spent hundreds of hours reading tons of articles on Wikipedia. And, yeah it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-GilesJ2005Internet-4" > reliable! </a> I especially enjoy Middle-eastern and European Imperialism. I simply like learning. And I like to promote learning. I am big supporter of STEM education initiatives and have some research experience in this field. This was a large portion of my undergraduate career. I'm not big on saving the whales, or boycotting Wal-Mart. My thing is STEM education.  </p>
                                    
                                <blockquote>But God being rich in mercy... made us alive together with Christ... and raised us up together with Him and <strong>seated us</strong> together with Him... - <a href="http://online.recoveryversion.bible/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6089&lvid=6091">Eph 2:4-6</a></blockquote>    
                                        
                                <p>Lastly, but most importantly (really, <i>most importantly</i> ), I am a lover of Jesus. I am not a follower of a religion or a teaching. I am in love with a person - Jesus! He is not just a compartmentalized facet of my daily activities. In fact, <strong>I am sitting</strong> with Him all the time (Eph. 2:6). This is to be in the position of rest. I am sitting with Christ in all circumstances (check out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Watchman_Nee_Sit_Walk_Stand?id=DnG4PxRgKKMC">Sit, Walk, Stand</a> by Watchman Nee). Christ is my life and I aspire that Christ would also be my living.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>Well... I decided to take a break from engineering. Currently, I'm in a 2-year Christian Bible and service program in California. It's been the best decision of my life. No, I won't become a theologian, or a professional pastor. Nor will I start my own church. I just want to spend some time (before adult life gets hectic) being trained in the truths of my faith and to serve others these wonderful truths.</p>

                                <p>Graduating college! My last year or so in college I was basically doing two things: senior design and working. </p>
                                <h3>Senior Design</h3>
									<div class="box">
                                        <p>My project was called <a href="http://cyclexpro.com">Cycle-X Pro</a>. In a nutshell, it is a Fitbit + LifeAlert for your bicycle. Visit the embedded site to find out more; there is a good video about it as well. I worked on pretty much all the software including the C code for the Arduino, the Django website, and the Android app. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/iamsitting">GitHub</a> to find out more. </p>

                                <h3>Embedded Software Engineer</h3>
									<div class="box">
										<p>While I was in school, I worked as a part-time software engineer for a small company in Bryan, Texas called Otis Instruments, Inc. Our main products were gas detection units for sites with hazardous gases (i.e chemical plants, refineries, etc.). Because these units are digitial and wireless, there was need for someone like me. I was programming in C on PIC Microcontrollers to add any necessary features to pre-existing software. I really enjoyed what I was doing because I got to handle the hardware as well.</p>
